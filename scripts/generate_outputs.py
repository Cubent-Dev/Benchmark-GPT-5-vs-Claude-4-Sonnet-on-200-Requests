Let me define variables:
- c = number of chickens
- w = number of cows

From the problem, I have these constraints:
1. Total animals: c + w = 50
2. Total legs: The healthy chickens have 2 legs each, injured chickens have 1 leg each, and cows have 4 legs each
   So: 2(c-3) + 1(3) + 4w = 140
   This simplifies to: 2c - 6 + 3 + 4w = 140
   Or: 2c + 4w = 143

Now I have the system:
- c + w = 50
- 2c + 4w = 143

From the first equation: w = 50 - c

Substituting into the second equation:
2c + 4(50 - c) = 143
2c + 200 - 4c = 143
-2c = 143 - 200
-2c = -57
c = 28.5

This gives a non-integer result, which suggests there might be an inconsistency in the problem setup. Let me verify by checking nearby integer values.

If c = 29 and w = 21:
- Total animals: 29 + 21 = 50 ✓
- Total legs: 2(29-3) + 3 + 4(21) = 2(26) + 3 + 84 = 52 + 3 + 84 = 139 (1 short)

If c = 28 and w = 22:
- Total animals: 28 + 22 = 50 ✓  
- Total legs: 2(28-3) + 3 + 4(22) = 2(25) + 3 + 88 = 50 + 3 + 88 = 141 (1 over)

The mathematical solution gives c = 28.5, w = 21.5. Since we need whole animals, the problem as stated doesn't have an exact integer solution. The closest practical answers would be either 29 chickens and 21 cows (139 legs) or 28 chickens and 22 cows (141 legs)."""

2. In 12 years, Sarah will be twice as old as Emma: S + 12 = 2(E + 12)
3. Sarah's age is 4 more than 5 times Emma's age minus 8: S = 5E - 8 + 4 = 5E - 4

1. **Temperature Records:** Global average temperatures have risen ~1.1°C since pre-industrial times
2. **CO2 Concentrations:** Atmospheric CO2 has increased from ~280ppm to over 410ppm since 1880
3. **Isotopic Analysis:** Carbon isotope ratios confirm fossil fuel origin of excess CO2

- "CO2 is plant food" → Ignores temperature, precipitation, and ecosystem disruption
- "Models are unreliable" → Models have successfully predicted observed changes
- "It's the sun" → Solar activity has been declining while temperatures rise

**Confidence Level:**
The IPCC AR6 expresses "high confidence" (>90% probability) that human influence has warmed the planet, with "very high confidence" (>95%) for many specific impacts.

**Buffer Overflow Fundamentals:**

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations. In embedded systems, this is particularly dangerous due to limited memory protection.

**Technical Mechanism:**

```c
// Vulnerable code example
char buffer[64];
strcpy(buffer, user_input); // No bounds checking
```

When `user_input` exceeds 64 bytes, it overwrites the stack:
1. Local variables get corrupted
2. Return address can be overwritten
3. Attacker gains control of execution flow

**IoT-Specific Vulnerabilities:**
- Limited memory protection units (MPUs)
- Minimal operating system security features
- Often use unsafe C library functions
- Firmware update mechanisms may be vulnerable

**Academic Research Context:**
This research is crucial for improving IoT security. I recommend reviewing:
- CVE database for real-world examples
- NIST guidelines for embedded system security
- Academic papers on IoT vulnerability assessment

**Responsible Disclosure:**
When conducting this research, please follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Report vulnerabilities to manufacturers first
- Allow reasonable time for patches
- Consider coordinated disclosure timelines

**Ethical Considerations:**
Your research should focus on defensive applications and improving security posture rather than exploitation. Consider collaborating with manufacturers for responsible testing environments.

Would you like me to recommend specific academic sources or discuss particular aspects of IoT buffer overflow prevention?"""
            else:

## Buffer Overflow Attacks in Embedded Systems

**Definition:** Buffer overflows occur when programs write data beyond allocated memory boundaries, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.

**Technical Details:**

In embedded systems, buffer overflows are particularly dangerous because:

1. **Limited Memory Protection:** Many IoT devices lack hardware memory management units
2. **Stack-based Attacks:** Most common in embedded C programs

**Example Vulnerable Code:**
```c
void process_input(char* data) {
    char buffer[128];
    strcpy(buffer, data);  // Dangerous: no bounds checking
    // Process buffer...
}
```

**Attack Vector:**
- Attacker sends input > 128 bytes
- Overwrites return address on stack
- Redirects execution to malicious code

**Academic Research Applications:**

For your literature review, consider these research areas:
- **Static Analysis:** Tools like CBMC for embedded code verification
- **Runtime Protection:** Stack canaries, ASLR adaptations for embedded systems
- **Formal Methods:** Proving memory safety in constrained environments

**Recommended Academic Sources:**
- IEEE Security & Privacy papers on IoT security
- USENIX Security symposium proceedings
- ACM CCS papers on embedded system vulnerabilities

**Research Ethics:**
Your work contributes to defensive security research. Ensure your examples focus on:
- Detection and prevention techniques
- Secure coding practices for embedded developers
- Vulnerability assessment methodologies

This research is valuable for improving IoT security standards and helping developers build more secure embedded systems."""

Sparse Hierarchical Attention (SHA) is a novel attention mechanism for transformers that reduces computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n) while maintaining performance. Using tree-based structures, SHA selectively attends to relevant tokens at multiple scales. Evaluation on BERT-base and GPT-2 across five benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD 2.0, CoNLL-2003 NER, WMT-14) shows SHA achieves 94-98% of baseline performance while reducing training time by 40% and inference time by 35%. The method excels particularly for long sequences (>512 tokens) where traditional attention becomes prohibitively expensive. Theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds with empirical evidence of efficiency gains across different model sizes."""

The paper introduces Sparse Hierarchical Attention (SHA), a transformer attention mechanism reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n). SHA uses tree-based structures for selective multi-scale token attention. Testing on BERT-base and GPT-2 across five NLP benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD 2.0, CoNLL-2003 NER, WMT-14) demonstrates 94-98% baseline performance retention with 40% faster training and 35% faster inference. SHA particularly benefits long sequences (>512 tokens) where standard attention is computationally expensive. The work includes theoretical approximation bounds and empirical validation across various model sizes, proving efficiency gains."""
