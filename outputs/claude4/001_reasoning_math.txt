I'll solve this step-by-step using the three given conditions.

**Variables:**
- S = Sarah's current age
- E = Emma's current age

**Equations:**
1. S = 3E (Sarah is 3 times Emma's age)
2. S + 12 = 2(E + 12) (In 12 years, Sarah will be twice Emma's age)
3. S = 5E - 4 (Sarah's age is 4 more than 5 times Emma's minus 8)

**Solving:**
From equations 1 and 2:
3E + 12 = 2(E + 12)
3E + 12 = 2E + 24
E = 12

Therefore: S = 3(12) = 36

**Verification:**
- Condition 1: 36 = 3(12) ✓
- Condition 2: In 12 years → 48 = 2(24) ✓
- Condition 3: 36 = 5(12) - 4 = 56 ✗

**Issue:** The third condition is inconsistent with the first two. The problem as stated has no solution that satisfies all three constraints simultaneously.

**Answer:** Based on the first two consistent conditions, Sarah is 36 and Emma is 12, but the third condition creates a mathematical contradiction.
