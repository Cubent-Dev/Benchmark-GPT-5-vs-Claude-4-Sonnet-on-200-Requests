This 100-word summary covers the key technical contributions:

The paper introduces Sparse Hierarchical Attention (SHA), a transformer attention mechanism reducing complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n). SHA uses tree-based structures for selective multi-scale token attention. Testing on BERT-base and GPT-2 across five NLP benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD 2.0, CoNLL-2003 NER, WMT-14) demonstrates 94-98% baseline performance retention with 40% faster training and 35% faster inference. SHA particularly benefits long sequences (>512 tokens) where standard attention is computationally expensive. The work includes theoretical approximation bounds and empirical validation across various model sizes, proving efficiency gains.
