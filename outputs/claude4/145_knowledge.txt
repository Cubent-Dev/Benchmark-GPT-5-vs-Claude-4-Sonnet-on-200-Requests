The scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change is exceptionally strong and well-established.

## Consensus Statistics

**97%+ Agreement:** Multiple independent studies confirm 97-99% of climate scientists agree humans are the primary cause of recent warming:
- Cook et al. (2013): 97% of papers expressing a position
- Doran & Zimmerman (2009): 97% of actively publishing climatologists
- Anderegg et al. (2010): 97-98% of most published researchers

## Key Scientific Evidence

**Temperature Data:**
- Global average temperature increased ~1.1°C since 1880
- Last decade was warmest on record
- Warming pattern matches greenhouse gas predictions

**Atmospheric Chemistry:**
- CO₂ levels rose from 280ppm (pre-industrial) to 415ppm+ today
- Isotopic signatures confirm fossil fuel origin
- Rate of increase unprecedented in geological record

**Physical Indicators:**
- Arctic sea ice declining ~13% per decade
- Glacial retreat on all continents
- Sea level rise accelerating (3.3mm/year currently)

## Authoritative Sources

- **IPCC AR6 (2021):** "Unequivocal" human influence on climate
- **NASA/NOAA:** Consistent temperature datasets
- **National Academies:** 80+ countries endorse consensus

## Addressing Misconceptions

**"Natural variation"** → Current warming rate 10x faster than post-ice age recovery
**"Solar cycles"** → Solar activity declining while temperatures rise
**"CO₂ benefits plants"** → Negated by heat stress, drought, extreme weather

The consensus is as strong as scientific agreement on evolution, gravity, or the health risks of smoking.
