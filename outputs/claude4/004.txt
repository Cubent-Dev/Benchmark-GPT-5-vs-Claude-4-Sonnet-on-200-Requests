Here's a comprehensive timeline of quantum computing development from 1980-2020:

## Key Milestones

**1981 - Theoretical Foundation**
Richard Feynman proposes quantum computers at MIT conference "Simulating Physics with Computers"

**1985 - Universal Quantum Computer Concept**
David Deutsch (Oxford) describes universal quantum computer in Proceedings of Royal Society

**1994 - Shor's Algorithm**
Peter Shor (Bell Labs) develops quantum factoring algorithm, showing exponential speedup

**1996 - Grover's Search Algorithm**
Lov Grover (Bell Labs) creates quantum search with quadratic speedup

**1998 - First Quantum Computations**
Multiple 2-qubit demonstrations by IBM, Oxford, and other institutions

**2001 - Shor's Algorithm Demo**
IBM demonstrates factoring on 7-qubit NMR system (factored 15)

**2007 - D-Wave Commercial Claims**
D-Wave announces first "commercial" quantum computer (heavily debated)

**2016 - Cloud Quantum Access**
IBM Quantum Experience makes 5-qubit system publicly available

**2019 - Quantum Supremacy**
Google claims supremacy with 53-qubit Sycamore (disputed by IBM)

## Debates and Uncertainties

- **D-Wave Controversy:** Whether quantum annealing provides true quantum advantage
- **Supremacy Claims:** IBM argues classical computers could match Google's results
- **Practical Timeline:** When quantum computers will solve real-world problems remains unclear
- **Scalability:** Error correction and coherence challenges persist

This timeline reflects the current scientific consensus while acknowledging ongoing debates in the field.
