The scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change is overwhelming and well-documented.

**Current Scientific Consensus:**
Multiple studies show 97-99% of actively publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are the primary driver of recent climate change. The most comprehensive analysis (Cook et al., 2013) found 97% consensus among papers expressing a position on the cause of global warming.

**Key Evidence:**
1. **Temperature Records:** Global average temperatures have risen ~1.1°C since pre-industrial times
2. **CO2 Concentrations:** Atmospheric CO2 has increased from ~280ppm to over 410ppm since 1880
3. **Isotopic Analysis:** Carbon isotope ratios confirm fossil fuel origin of excess CO2
4. **Ice Core Data:** Current CO2 levels are highest in 800,000+ years
5. **Sea Level Rise:** ~20cm rise since 1900, accelerating in recent decades

**Major Scientific Reports:**
- IPCC Assessment Reports (AR6, 2021-2023): "Unequivocal" human influence
- NASA/NOAA temperature datasets showing consistent warming
- National Academy of Sciences statements from 80+ countries

**Common Misconceptions Addressed:**
- "Climate has always changed naturally" → Current rate and pattern unprecedented
- "CO2 is plant food" → Ignores temperature, precipitation, and ecosystem disruption
- "Models are unreliable" → Models have successfully predicted observed changes
- "It's the sun" → Solar activity has been declining while temperatures rise

**Confidence Level:**
The IPCC AR6 expresses "high confidence" (>90% probability) that human influence has warmed the planet, with "very high confidence" (>95%) for many specific impacts.

This represents one of the strongest scientific consensuses in modern science, comparable to the consensus on evolution or the link between smoking and cancer.
