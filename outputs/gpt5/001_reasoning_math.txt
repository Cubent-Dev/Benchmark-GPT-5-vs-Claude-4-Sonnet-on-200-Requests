I need to set up equations based on the age relationships given.

Let me define:
- S = Sarah's current age
- E = Emma's current age

From the problem:
1. Sarah is currently 3 times as old as Emma: S = 3E
2. In 12 years, Sarah will be twice as old as Emma: S + 12 = 2(E + 12)
3. Sarah's age is 4 more than 5 times Emma's age minus 8: S = 5E - 8 + 4 = 5E - 4

From equations 1 and 3:
3E = 5E - 4
-2E = -4
E = 2

Therefore: S = 3(2) = 6

Let me verify with equation 2:
In 12 years: Sarah = 6 + 12 = 18, Emma = 2 + 12 = 14
Is 18 = 2(14)? Yes, 18 = 28... wait, that's not right.

Let me recalculate equation 2:
S + 12 = 2(E + 12)
6 + 12 = 2(2 + 12)
18 = 2(14) = 28

This doesn't work. Let me check my algebra again.

From S = 3E and S + 12 = 2(E + 12):
3E + 12 = 2E + 24
E = 12

So S = 3(12) = 36

Checking: In 12 years, Sarah = 48, Emma = 24. Is 48 = 2(24)? Yes!
Checking equation 3: Is 36 = 5(12) - 4 = 60 - 4 = 56? No.

There seems to be an inconsistency in the problem constraints.
