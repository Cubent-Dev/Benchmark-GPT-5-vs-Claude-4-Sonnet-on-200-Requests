Here's a comprehensive timeline of major quantum computing milestones from 1980-2020:

**1981: Theoretical Foundation**
- Richard Feynman proposes quantum computers at MIT's "Simulating Physics with Computers" conference
- Suggests quantum systems could efficiently simulate other quantum systems

**1985: Universal Quantum Computer**
- David Deutsch (Oxford) describes the universal quantum computer concept
- Published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London

**1994: Shor's Algorithm**
- Peter Shor (Bell Labs) develops quantum algorithm for integer factorization
- Demonstrates exponential speedup over classical algorithms for cryptographically relevant problems

**1996: Grover's Algorithm**
- Lov Grover (Bell Labs) creates quantum search algorithm
- Provides quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems

**1998: First Quantum Computations**
- Multiple groups demonstrate 2-qubit quantum computations
- IBM, Oxford, and other institutions achieve basic quantum operations

**2001: Shor's Algorithm Demonstration**
- IBM demonstrates Shor's algorithm on a 7-qubit NMR quantum computer
- Successfully factors the number 15 (though with some controversy about true "quantum" nature)

**2007: D-Wave's Commercial Claims**
- D-Wave Systems announces first "commercial" quantum computer
- Significant debate in scientific community about whether it's truly quantum

**2011: D-Wave One**
- D-Wave releases 128-qubit quantum annealer
- Continues debate about quantum advantage vs. classical systems

**2016: IBM Quantum Experience**
- IBM makes 5-qubit quantum computer available via cloud
- Democratizes access to quantum computing for researchers and students

**2019: Quantum Supremacy Claims**
- Google claims quantum supremacy with 53-qubit Sycamore processor
- IBM disputes the claim, arguing classical computers could match performance

**Uncertainties and Debates:**
- D-Wave's quantum nature remains debated
- Google's supremacy claim contested by IBM and others
- Timeline of practical quantum advantage still uncertain
- Scalability challenges persist across all approaches
