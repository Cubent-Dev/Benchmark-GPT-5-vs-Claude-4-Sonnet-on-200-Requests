Looking at this quarterly sales data, I'll calculate growth rates and provide strategic insights.

**Growth Rate Analysis:**

Product A: Q1 $125K → Q4 $165K
- Growth rate: (165-125)/125 = 32% annual growth
- Quarterly trend: Steady upward trajectory

Product B: Q1 $89K → Q4 $128K
- Growth rate: (128-89)/89 = 44% annual growth
- Strongest performer with consistent acceleration

Product C: Q1 $156K → Q4 $167K
- Growth rate: (167-156)/156 = 7% annual growth
- Mature product with minimal growth

**Marketing ROI Analysis:**

Total revenue growth: $370K → $460K = 24.3% increase
Marketing spend increase: $45K → $58K = 29% increase

ROI by quarter:
- Q1: $370K revenue / $45K marketing = $8.22 per dollar
- Q4: $460K revenue / $58K marketing = $7.93 per dollar

**Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Focus on Product B**: Highest growth rate (44%) with strong momentum
2. **Optimize Product C**: Large revenue base but stagnant growth needs attention
3. **Marketing efficiency**: ROI slightly declining, need better targeting
4. **Resource allocation**: Shift 60% of marketing budget to Product B, 30% to revitalizing Product C

**Key Insights:**
- Product B shows exponential growth potential
- Marketing spend efficiency needs improvement
- Product portfolio diversification is healthy but needs rebalancing
